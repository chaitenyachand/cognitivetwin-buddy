Your personal AI study partner, adapting to your unique learning style.

The Cognitive Twin isn't just another study app; it's a dynamic, multi-modal learning companion. It acts as a personal tutor that intelligently identifies your knowledge gaps and creates focused study materials just for you. It moves beyond static text, offering a fully interactive, voice-driven Socratic experience to build true understanding.



## The Problem

Traditional education is "one-size-fits-all," but students aren't. Learning from static textbooks is inefficient, leading to wasted time on concepts we already know and deep frustration on the ones we don't. This creates gaps in knowledge that hold learners back.

## Our Solution

Our solution provides two distinct, powerful learning modes to solve this problem:

1.  **The Structured Learner (Text-Based):** For students who want a complete, self-paced study guide.
2.  **The Conversational Learner (Voice-Based):** For students who want an interactive, guided tutoring session with a live AI.

## Key Features

### The Text-Based Learning Module
* **Generate Complete Study Guides:** Turn any topic (from a text prompt or PDF) into a full set of study materials:
    * Detailed Summaries
    * Hierarchical Mind Maps
    * Interactive Flashcards
    * Key Formulas & Concepts
* **Intelligent Quiz Agent:** Take an AI-generated quiz to test your knowledge.
* **Agent-Driven Focused Review:** This is the core of our "Cognitive Twin." Our agent analyzes your quiz results and automatically generates a *new* "Focused Review Module" that *only* covers the topics you struggled with. No more wasted time.

### The Socratic Voice Tutor
This is our star feature—a 100% free, voice-and-avatar-driven conversational tutor.

* **Voice-First Socratic Dialogue:** Have a natural, guided conversation with your AI tutor. It won't just give you answers; it will ask you guiding questions to help *you* discover the solution.
* **Custom AI Avatar:** A custom-designed avatar (`avatar.avif`) speaks the AI's responses, creating a human-like, engaging, and personal experience.
* **Real-Time Chained AI:** This feature is powered by a sophisticated chain of AI models:
    1.  Your voice is transcribed to text.
    2.  An AI "brain" analyzes the conversation and formulates a Socratic response.
    3.  A separate AI model generates a new audio file of that response.
    4.  A final AI model animates your avatar's lips to perfectly match the new audio, creating a seamless talking video.

## How to Use

1.  **Log In:** Create an account or log in to your personal dashboard.
2.  **Choose Your Method:**
    * Click **"Start New Topic"** for the structured, text-based lesson and quiz generator.
    * Click **"Start Socratic Session"** to launch the AI Voice Tutor.
3.  **Learn:**
    * If using the text module, study your materials and take your quiz to get a focused review.
    * If using the voice tutor, just start talking! The AI will guide you from there.

## Future Vision

This project is the foundation for a truly ubiquitous, 1-on-1 tutor. Future plans include long-term knowledge tracking to monitor student growth across all subjects and a full mobile application for on-the-go learning.
